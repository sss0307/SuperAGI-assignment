Q/A Assignment 

1. With identical features, in comes multicollinearity which reduces the interpretability of a model. Also, can make the model less robust. 

2. a) Inconclusive (We have too little data to conclude that A is better or worse than any other template with 95% confidence.)
      But, we can perform a power analysis to determine the number of emails to be sent for a definitve answer.

3. The comp. cost is commonly propotional to the number of non-0 entries in pytorch.
   In this case, O(k). Ideally, O(k*m)

4. Ranking the approaches : a>c>b
   Assuming, V1 model is a fairly good model and classifies well enough, 
   The 'a' method is really effective cause it will drive V2 to higher f1 scores. (less uncertainity)  
   The 'c' method is also effective but, based on number of wrongly classified examples in the 10k, the training may also result in reinforcing the existing decision boundary. 
   
   Ideally, Combining methods 'c' and 'a' is much better.

5. a) MLE: k/n
   b) BE : (k+1)/(n+2)
   c) MAP: k/n
